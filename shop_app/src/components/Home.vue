The actual shoot date was unusually cold for April and was tough to work through for all of the actors wearing shorts and athletic gear. Our dancers warmed themselves up in a tight huddle as we filmed a sweeping choreographed shot following our iconic FUBU handshake. This would become a recurring element as we transition from scene to scene.</th>
